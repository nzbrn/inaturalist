<h1>NatureWatch NZ Privacy Policy</h1>

<h2>Website Visitors</h2>

<p>
  Like most website operators, the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust collects
  non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
  servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
  preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
  the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
  information is to better understand how NatureWatch NZ's visitors use its
  website. From time to time, the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust may release
  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
  a report on trends in the usage of its website.
</p>

<p>
  NatureWatch NZ also collects potentially personally-identifying information
  like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust does not use such
  information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such
  information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
  discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
</p>

<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>
  Certain visitors to the the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust's NatureWatch NZ website choose to interact with
  NatureWatch NZ in ways that require the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust to gather
  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
  the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each
  case, the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust collects such information only insofar as is necessary
  or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
  NatureWatch NZ. The New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust does not disclose personally-identifying
  information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to
  supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
  prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>
  The New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
  website. For instance, the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust may reveal how many downloads a
  particular observation got. However, the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust does not disclose
  personally-identifying information other than as described below.
</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>
  The New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only to those of its programmers,
  contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
  information in order to process it on the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust's behalf or to provide
  services available at the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust's websites, and (ii) that have agreed
  not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
  affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
  using the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust's websites, you consent to the transfer of such
  information to them. The New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust will not rent or sell potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
  Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as
  described above, the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust discloses potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when
  required to do so by law, or when the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust believes in good faith
  that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
  the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a
  registered user of the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust and have supplied your email address,
  the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
  features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's
  going on with the NatureWatch NZ website and our products. We primarily use blogs and
  groups to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this
  type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
  support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right
  to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
  help us support other users. The New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust takes all measures reasonably
  necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
  destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
  information.
</p>

<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p>
  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
  computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time
  the visitor returns. The New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust uses cookies to help the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust
  identify and track visitors, their usage of the NatureWatch NZ website, and
  their website access preferences. NatureWatch NZ visitors who do not wish
  to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
  refuse cookies before using the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust's websites, with the drawback
  that certain features of the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust's websites may not function
  properly without the aid of cookies.
</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

<p>
  Although most changes are likely to be minor, the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust may change its
  Privacy Policy from time to time, and in the New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust's sole discretion.
  The New Zealand Bio-Recording Network Trust encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
  changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any
  change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
  change.
