  Your NatureWatch NZ account is currently linked to your Flickr account.

<p>
  Keeping your NatureWatch NZ account linked to your Flickr account allows you to
  add multiple photos to your observations.  Of course, if you ever want
  NatureWatch NZ and Flickr to break up, we won't stop you, you just won't be
  able to add photos. Sometimes this might be for the best, like if you create
  a new Flickr account that you want to link NatureWatch NZ to.

<h3>Your NatureWatch NZ account is not linked to your Flickr account :(</h3>
<p class="description">
  To connect Flickr with NatureWatch NZ, click the link on the right and sign into
  Flickr.com. Flickr will ask you if you want to give NatureWatch NZ permission
  to <strong>read</strong> from your Flickr account and will then send you
  back here. We also ask for <strong>write</strong> permission so you can add
  taxonomic tags back to your Flickr photos using the <%= link_to "Flickr
  Tagger", flickr_tagger_path %>.
</p>
<p class="description">
  We will never ask you for your Flickr password (but Flickr might, check the
  url that the button sends you and make sure it's Flickr.com). We will also
  won't change your Flickr data unless you want us to. We're the good guys!
</p>

<p class="description">
  Also, keep in mind that if you log in to NatureWatch NZ via Flickr, we will
  automatically re-link your NatureWatch NZ and Flickr accounts. Seems reasonable that
  if you use Flickr you'll want to be able to import Flickr photos, right?
